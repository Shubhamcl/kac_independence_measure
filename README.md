# kac_independence_measure
Kac independence measure (KacIM) is multivariate statistical dependence measure, 
which can detect arbitrary statistical dependence between two random vectors (similar to mutual information, Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), etc.). The idea of KacIM is to apply Kac theorem for characteristic functions, and maximimize expected lenght of difference 
between joint and marginal characteristic functions (two complex random variables). 
This repository includes basic implementation of KacIM, and one very basic demonstration, which show that KacIM works for high-dimensional data.
